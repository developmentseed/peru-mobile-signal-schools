# Mobile Signal Coverage in Educational Institutions of Peru

This project focuses on overcoming the challenge posed by mobile signal coverage in educational institutions in Peru, a nation renowned for its vast geographical diversity and enriching culture. In the current context, where virtual education has taken a leading role, an essential question arises: Do all Peruvian students enjoy the same opportunities to access education?

To address this issue, we have combined various datasets, including information on mobile service coverage by operator, images from the Aster Global Digital Elevation Model, and the locations of educational centers obtained from OpenStreetMap, which were imported by our team. Using this data, we developed a 3D visualization tool that highlights the location of educational institutions and mobile phone antennas from different providers across the country.

## Analysis

Our analysis reveals the existence of areas in Peru where mobile service quality is insufficient or directly nonexistent. We identified antennas that, despite their proximity to communities, suffer signal interruptions due to their geographical location, thus limiting signal access in educational institutions and nearby towns.

## Critical Questions

- What innovative strategies could we implement to enhance access to education in these regions?
- What opportunities are being denied to students who lack internet access?

## Important Note

It is vital to highlight that, although our study is based on standardized criteria and shows consistency, it is not completely free from certain margins of error. To achieve a more precise and comprehensive perspective, it is imperative to integrate additional datasets.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into two main folders:

- **web**: Houses all the files and resources necessary to operate the visualization tool.
- **data_process**: Contains scripts and tools aimed at processing and preparing the data for subsequent visualization.
